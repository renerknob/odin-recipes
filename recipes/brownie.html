        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Cookie Layer</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Brownie Layer</strong></p>

            <li>1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
